Understanding JavaScript Execution: Before and After Node.js
Introduction
This document aims to provide an overview of how JavaScript code was executed before and after the advent of Node.js. JavaScript, 
initially designed for the client-side scripting of web pages, has evolved significantly, enabling server-side scripting and a wide range of other applications.
Node.js, a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, revolutionized JavaScript's role beyond the browser environment.

Before Node.js
Client-Side Execution
Before the emergence of Node.js, JavaScript primarily ran in web browsers. It was interpreted and executed by the browser's JavaScript engine. 
JavaScript was used to enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of web pages. However, its usage was confined to client-side scripting within the browser environment.

Limitations
Restricted Environment: JavaScript was limited to the capabilities of web browsers, restricting its usage to client-side scripting.
Lack of Server-Side Processing: Performing server-side tasks, such as file system operations or network requests, was not feasible using JavaScript alone.
Concurrency Challenges: Handling concurrent connections efficiently posed challenges due to JavaScript's single-threaded nature within the browser.
After Node.js
Server-Side Execution
The introduction of Node.js expanded JavaScript's horizons beyond the browser. It provided a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser environment,
enabling server-side scripting. Node.js leverages the V8 JavaScript engine to execute code, making JavaScript a viable choice for building scalable and high-performance server applications.

Key Features and Advantages
Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js adopts an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, enabling efficient handling of concurrent connections and I/O operations.
Single JavaScript Language: Developers can now use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, promoting code reuse and simplifying the development process.
Vast Ecosystem: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, facilitating rapid development and enabling a wide range of applications, including web servers, RESTful APIs, real-time applications,
and more.
Scalability: Node.js enables building scalable applications due to its non-blocking, asynchronous nature, making it suitable for handling large numbers of concurrent connections.
Examples of Node.js Applications
Web Servers: Node.js can be used to create fast and scalable web servers. Frameworks like Express.js simplify the process of building robust server-side applications.
API Servers: Node.js is commonly used to build RESTful APIs, providing a lightweight and efficient solution for serving and consuming data.
Real-time Applications: With the support for WebSockets and event-driven architecture, Node.js is ideal for building real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming platforms, and collaboration tools.


Conclusion
Node.js has transformed the JavaScript landscape, empowering developers to build a wide range of applications beyond the confines of the browser.
By providing a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, Node.js has opened up new possibilities for building scalable, efficient, and high-performance applications.
From client-side scripting to full-stack development, JavaScript's journey has been truly revolutionary, thanks to the advent of Node.js.
